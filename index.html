            I am chemical engineer from Ecuador.
            I had the opportunity to study at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa Maria.
            I lived in Chile for 6 months and I took several courses about bioprocess engineering, instrumental analysis and microbiology.
            After graduating from ESPOL, I worked with Santiago Salas on a conference paper.
            I aided in the literature review to produce a detailed process description and I took part in the development of the Python framework.

            I started working for ABInBev as a Beer Intern. 
            During this programme, I was in charge of a project to reduce the extract loss in the fermentation process.
            Six months later, I became a quality analyst and I gained an profound experience in bioprocess systems.

        Air separation systems are crucial in the production of oxygen, which has gained particular relevance during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mechanical ventilation can compensate respiratory deficiencies along with the use of medical oxygen in vulnerable patients infected with this disease. In this contribution, a many-objective simulation-based optimization framework is proposed for determining eleven decision variables for the operation of an air separation unit.
