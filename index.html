            I am chemical engineer from Ecuador.
            After graduating from ESPOL, I worked with Santiago Salas on a conference paper.
            I aided in the literature review to produce a detailed process description and I took part in the development of the Python framework.  
            Having working as a quality analyst in ABInBev in Guayaquil, I managed to gain an profound experience in bioprocess systems and fermentation processes.

        Air separation systems are crucial in the production of oxygen, which has gained particular relevance during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mechanical ventilation can compensate respiratory deficiencies along with the use of medical oxygen in vulnerable patients infected with this disease. In this contribution, a many-objective simulation-based optimization framework is proposed for determining eleven decision variables for the operation of an air separation unit.
